## Compiling and Running an MPI program
`mpicc` is a wrapper for the gcc compiler that simplifies compiling MPI 
programs. It finds the appropriate MPI header files and handles linking object
files to MPI libraries.

```
# compiling
mpicc -g -Wall -o program program.c
```

`mpiexec` starts *n* number of instances of the program and handles the
communication between them. *n* is the number of processors specified to use.

```
# running
mpiexec -n 2 --mca opal_warn_on_missing_libcuda 0 ./program
```
